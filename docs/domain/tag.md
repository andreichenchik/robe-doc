# Tag

A user-defined label attached to [Items](/domain/item) for flexible organization beyond the [Category](/domain/category) hierarchy.

Tags allow users to create their own groupings (e.g. "summer", "work", "favorites", "to donate").

## Properties

- **Name** — the label text displayed on the tag.

> - Does a Tag have a color or icon?
> - Are Tags unique per user (global) or can they overlap?
> - Is there a maximum length for Tag names?
> - Can Tags be applied to Outfits, or only to Items?

## Relationships

- A Tag can be attached to zero or more [Items](/domain/item).
- Tags are used as a filter dimension in [Wardrobe Filtering](/features/wardrobe-filtering).

## Business Rules

- Tags are created by the user (not auto-detected by AI).

> [!NOTE]
> **Undefined — requires clarification:**
> - Are tags auto-suggested based on existing tags?
> - What happens to a tag when all items using it are deleted?
> - Is there a limit on tags per item or total tags per user?
